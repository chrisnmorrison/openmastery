## Why Contribute?

Unlike most platforms, our driving force isn't profit. We're committed to donating 100% of our proceeds to charity! [Learn more about our mission](https://openmastery.one/about). By learning on our platform, you're not only enhancing your skills but also helping those in need. Our innovative fundraising approach doesn't require you to donate your own money.

Contributing is straightforward and impactful. Even if you're not a coder, you can contribute by sharing knowledge. Your contributions, no matter the size, can be added to your resume and portfolio.

Let's collaborate to create something remarkable.

## General Info

We offer a collection of text-based courses for free. We encourage users to [contribute their own courses](./GUIDE_TO_CREATE_COURSES.md) or [add to our existing ones](./GUIDE_TO_UPDATE_COURSES.md). By contributing, you're part of an open-source project and creating content you can showcase on your resume.

## Technologies

Open Mastery is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator. Before diving into our project, we recommend you review [Docusaurus' documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

We craft our pages using Markdown and React. You don't need to know React to contribute—most of our pages are Markdown-based. However, if you're interested, contributing to React pages offers a valuable learning opportunity.

## How to Contribute

We aim to make Open Mastery one of the most beginner-friendly open-source projects to contribute to.

Our beginner contributions:

Our intermediate contributions:

- Improving site layout
- Enhancing SEO
